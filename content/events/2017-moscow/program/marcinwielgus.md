During this talk I will discuss the architecture and key components of Kubernetes - a production-ready, open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. I will explain the concepts of Pod, ReplicaSet, Deployment, Service and Autoscaling and show how they can be applied to build and effectively run a simple website.
