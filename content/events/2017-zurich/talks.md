            <h4>Improving Time to Market: The new speed of DevOps in a corporate environment</h4>
            <b>Beat Stutz - SIX</b>
            <p>SIX has started the transformation to DevOps in 2015, being one of the first larger businesses in the Swiss financial sector to do so. The presentation will show the journey of one of the DevOps teams – the approach, the results and the learnings on the way from traditional “silo’ed” organization with waterfall methods to a new cross-functional, agile team, with a focus on improving speed by eliminating waste and through automation.</p>
            <p>About our Company:<br>
            SIX operates a competitive infrastructure for the Swiss financial center, catering to a broad, international client base. Its four business areas provide a comprehensive range of services in the areas of securities transactions, financial information processing and cashless payment transactions."</p>

            <h4>You’re monitoring containers wrong</h4>
            <b>Jorge Salamero Sanz - Sysdic</b>
            <p>I hate to say it, but there’s a lot of bad advice out there on how to monitor your containers in production. In this talk I hope to add some much-needed clarity on how to best monitor containers to manage the health of your applications.</p>
            <p>My advice is built off our experience creating container monitoring solutions, and the information we’ve gotten from working with hundreds of customers deploying Docker. I’ll cover key questions like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why is it so hard to get visibility into Docker containers?</li>
                <li>How far can you get with the Docker stats API?</li>
                <li>What metrics really matter for your containerized applications?</li>
                <li>How does Kubernetes improve monitoring? How does it get in the way?</li>
                <li>What open source tools can help with these challenges?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to this theory, I’ll get into some real examples that will ground our discussion. You’ll walk away with a new appreciation of what it takes to monitor your environment right, as well as a few ideas that you can put into practice right away.</p>

            <h4>Continuous Performance Delivery: Find and fix the things that matter</h4>
            <b>Tharmes Siva - Riverbed</b>
            <p>Businesses want to ensure that their end users are happy so they can maximize productivity, loyalty, and profits. But poor performing applications cause serious business issues. In today’s DevOps organizations and agile environments, it is essential to ensure application performance management throughout the full application lifecycle from the End User to Infrastructure.</p>
            <p>To achieve this, modern application performance management faces a challenge:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>On one hand, it has to be extremely flexible and agile</li>
            <li>On the other hand has to provide all necessary information on all transactions end-to-end in production as well as development and test environments so that people are talking the same language.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because DevOps is about speed and iterations, we will share in this presentation a performance management philosophy which will maximize the value of Devops for high performing applications. It allows you to find and fix the things that really matter instead of hunting ghost performance problems with your DevOps groups.</p>
            <p>Presenter:<br>

            <h4>Our Continuous Delivery Journey</h4>
            <b>Suzie Prince - Thoughtworks</b>
            <p>The journey to continuous delivery (CD) is long, winding and always evolving. We thought we had achieved all we could with continuous delivery and then… something changed. We soon realized that we weren’t doing all we could to continuously deliver. Come learn from my experiences at ThoughtWorks as I talk about the lessons we have learned on our CD journey.</p>
            <p>Attendees will leave with a set of tips to act as a guide on their journey to continuous delivery. I will start at the beginning and define CD, talk about the underlying practices and cultures you need to get started and share some tips to take home.</p>
            <p>About Suzie Prince:<br>

            <b>Chris Van Tuin - Red Hat</b>
            <p>Data breaches are on the rise and placing increased pressure on Enterprise IT to protect the business.  With the rise of DevOps and as hackers takes advantage of known vulnerabilities on unpatched or misconfigured systems, Enterprise IT increasingly needs to automate vulnerability management, security management, and compliance checking.  OpenSCAP is an opensource tool for automatically verifying the presence of patches, checking system security configuration settings, and examining systems for signs of compromise.</p>
            <p>In this presentation, you'll learn about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How Containers enable DevOps, Container Technology, and the security risks with deploying containers in the enterprise</li>
                <li>Security vulnerability (CVEs) and Configuration issues (CCEs) notifications and checks</li>
                <li>Automating vulnerability management, security management, and compliance checking with OpenSCAP</li>

            <h4>New ways to effectively develop a DevOps culture</h4>
            <b>Cyrill Ruetimann - IPT</b>
            <p>I was working in agile projects for more than 10 years now. But I have never been in a team reaching the hyper performance phase. Nor while working as number 2 in a start up nor in a small team embodied in a multinational global player. With DevOps, new specialists joining the team. The diversity grows and that will it not make easier to develop such a culture. Kaikaku, that’s the Japanese word for breaking off, doing experiments and implement distruptive changes if needed. That’s the recipe to develop a highly performing team or to find new ways. I had the chance to learn and implement three different methods which support such a culture. The results while applying those methods where stunning – positively. My hands-on experience with Lego Serious Play, Complex Problem Solving and Foursight have clearly shown, that it is worth to think outside the box and to left behind traditional management instruments. Culture is more important than before. To build bridges and solutions as a team is a core competence in a DevOps team. Those three methods will enrich your way to develop a DevOps culture. In my presentation, I will introduce the three methods based on real-life applications and will show you, how they can help to build bridges.</p>

              <h4>What We Talk About When We Talk About Distributed Systems</h4>
              <b>Alvaro Videla</b>
              <p>Distributed Systems are a complex topic. There's abundant research about it but sometimes it is hard for a beginner to know where to start. I would like to outline the main concepts of distributed systems, so the interested person can have a clear path on how to start their own research as well. In this talk I will review the different models: asynchronous vs. synchronous distributed systems; message passing vs shared memory communication; failure detectors and leader election problems; consensus and different kinds of replication.</p>
              <p>I will also review a series of books on distributed systems in order to recommend the best one according to the topics we would like to learn about, or the problems we would like to solve. The goal of the talk is to set a good foundation for people interested in learning more about distributed systems.</p>
              <p>Talk objectives:</p>
              <p>When learning about Distributed Systems there are lot of books and papers to chose from, with many of them having titles that are hard to understand. It's difficult then to judge their relevance to our interests if we don't know the topic already. The goal of the talk is to lay a common ground for Distributed Systems so everyone can benefit from the current research on the topic.</p>
              <p>Target audience:</p>
              <p>Engineers interested in getting started with Distributed Systems.</p>
              <p>Bio:<br>Alvaro Videla works as a Distributed Systems Engineer and previously was a Core Developer for RabbitMQ. Before moving to Europe he used to work in Shanghai where he helped building one of Germany biggest dating websites. He co-authored the book ""RabbitMQ in Action"" for Manning Publishing. Some of his open source projects can be found here: http://github.com/videlalvaro. Apart from code related stuff he likes traveling with his wife, listening/playing music and reading books. You can find him on Twitter as @old_sound.</p>

          <h4>Massively Distributed Backups at Facebook Scale</h4>
          <b>Dan Reif - Facebook</b>
          <p>MySQL is at the core of Facebook's persistent storage. The graph itself, including every like, comment, post and status, is stored in MySQL, along with many other things. This data is the company's most important asset, and we take great care to make sure everything is properly backed up. Yes, even the lolcats and puppy picture posts. Everything!</p>
          <p>As you can imagine, backing up this behemoth of a dataset is quite a challenge. The backup system Facebook runs for MySQL is multi-tiered and massively distributed. We employ binary log, full, and differential backups and clever hacks to balance speed, space and reliability.</p>
          <p>In this talk you'll learn how we backup Facebook, every single day. We'll go over the design, engineering and operational challenges we've had to overcome, and wrap up with some fun war stories.</p>
          <p>DevOps Relevance: At the core of DevOps is monitoring and orchestration.  The talk is not built as a polished set-piece, but instead as a series of improvements (and snags we hit along the way).  The overall theme is one of managing complexity via code rather than with more humans.</p>
